A simple guess the number game
range is between 1 and 20
with 7 guesses available

Changes and Improvement I want to implement:

A loop after game that will prompt user if they want to play again
  -depending on answer, the game will either start again or exit
  
A way to catch errors if the user inputs a letter rather than an integer
    -prevent it from breaking the code and rather send out an error message "invalid input"
